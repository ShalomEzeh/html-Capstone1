    <p>I love to put in my best at work, but when I am not working, I love to kick back, relax and have a good time. That way, when i return to work, i can come back refresh, revived and ready to go.  <br >  </p> 
    
    <p> Below I have put together a list of my top favorite hobbies </p>

        <li><h4>Speaking</h4></li>
        If there was one thing I had to do for the rest of my life for free, it would be sharing every little thing I learn with everyone I come across.<br >
        I feel passion crossing through my veins when I speak, I chersih every moment and opportunity i get.<br >

        <li><h4>Reading</h4></li>
        I love books that explore the mind, the beauty and complexity of the world unseen that we all carry everywhere we go, the very world that mirrors all of our being. <br >
        Reading books that share light on the mind is one of my favorite hobbies.<br >
